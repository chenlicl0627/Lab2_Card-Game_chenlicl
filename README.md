# A brief intro to lab2

This program is a simple card game where there are two players and each of them have a deck of 52 cards.
When the game begins, each player take turns to show a card from their decks. The person shows the card with a greater number will get one point. If both of them have the same number, no one wins any point. When both players run out of cards, it's time to calculate the total points and the person with more points wins the game.
